<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey my name's Aleksi and I'm from Finland. My goal in life is to become a full stack developer and build my career in the tech industry.</p>

I originally graduated as a restaurant cook at my culinary school at Turku's vocational school and worked in the restaurant industry for a couple of years. Later on I started to ponder whether working in a kitchen was really my thing. So, one summer I decided to apply to a big Finnish telecommunications company called DNA and work there as a salesman without any prior knowledge about the job. To my surprise I quickly discovered that I was perfectly capable of doing this kind of work and learned that I didn't really have any desire to go back working at the food industry. </p>
<p>And the years after I worked at different kind of customer service jobs and office jobs but at the same time kept looking for different opportunities to truly discover what was the career or job I was really interested in. </p>
<p>Well... after spending months and months trying to understand myself better, I discovered programming. It was something that I already slightly tipped my toes in previously but couldn't exactly get a hold of it some years ago. But after all that soul searching, I started to understand what kind of a career would most likely fit my own persona the closest. It definitely feels like it would be coding. And as a scientific study that I read somewhere stated that "human's logical capability grows stronger the older you get" was something that made me think I could actually see myself understanding more about programming than I did years ago as a teenager.</p>

<p>So, here I am as of today, I strive to become a developer and get my foot inside the tech industry. And build many great projects, solve problems and explore the creative side of myself.
